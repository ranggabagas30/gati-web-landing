# Change: Update About Us Section Background Color

## Why
The About Us section (ManifestoSection) currently uses a black background. Changing it to the primary brand color (orange `#f05123`) will improve visual consistency with the brand identity and create a more cohesive design that aligns with the primary accent color used throughout the site.

## What Changes
- Change the background color of the ManifestoSection component from black (`bg-black`) to primary orange (`bg-[#f05123]`)
- Update the text color if needed to maintain proper contrast and readability

## Impact
- Affected specs: `landing-page` (new capability)
- Affected code: `src/app/components/ManifestoSection.tsx` (line 48)
